/**
 *
 * ASGlobalOverlay is a 'pop-over' controller that can display alerts, slide-up menus, and working indicators on top of your app.
 *
 * ## Setup
 *
 * ASGlobalOverlay should not be directly initialized.
 * Instead, call +setupGlobalOverlay on ASGlobalOverlay in application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:, then utilize the class methods on ASGlobalOverlay from anywhere in your app.
 *
 * ## Implementation & Behavior Details
 *
 * - ASGlobalOverlay will not appear over (or disable) a keyboard.
 * - It is recommended that you dismiss the keyboard before showing something with ASGlobalOverlay. Check out the example app for details.
 * - ASGlobalOverlay methods that show or dismiss views should only be called on the main thread.
 *
 * ## Learn More
 *
 * Please reference the README on GitHub for additional detail.
 * URL GOES HERE
 *
 * ## Acknowledgements
 *
 * ASGlobalOverlay was inspired by the SVProgressHUD library.
 * Furthermore, the high-level architecture of this library (and one specific method) is largely based on the SVProgressHUD code.
 * The SVProgressHUD contributors have put together a great library, and deserve major kudos for their work.
 * (https://github.com/SVProgressHUD/SVProgressHUD)
 *
 * On a related note, since ASGlobalOverlay and SVProgressHUD both utilize the same code to position themselves in the view hierarchy, it is not recommended that you use them together.
 *
